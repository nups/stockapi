# Found OAuth Consent Screen - Navigate to Test Users

## 🎯 Current Location: Google Auth Platform → Branding

Perfect! You're now in the OAuth consent screen area. I can see:
- ✅ **App name**: "Stock api" (you might want to change this to "Stock Watchlist App")
- ✅ **User support email**: noopurshukla2012@gmail.com
- ✅ You're in the right section!

## 🔍 Navigate to Test Users Section

From your current screen, look at the **left sidebar**. I can see:
- 📋 Overview
- 🎨 **Branding** ← (You are here)
- 👥 **Audience** ← **This is likely where test users are!**
- 🔗 Clients
- 🔒 Data Access
- ✅ Verification Center
- ⚙️ Settings

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### **Click on "Audience" in the left sidebar**
The "Audience" section is where Google typically puts test user management for OAuth consent screens.

### **What to Look for in Audience Section:**
- Test users management
- User access controls
- External user settings

## 🔧 Alternative: Complete Current Section First

Before going to Audience, you might want to complete the current Branding section:

### **App Information Updates:**
1. **Change App name** from "Stock api" to "Stock Watchlist App"
2. **App logo**: Skip (not required)
3. **Add App domains** if there are fields for:
   - Application home page: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Authorized domains: `localhost`

### **Then Save and Continue**

## 🚨 If "Audience" Doesn't Have Test Users

If the Audience section doesn't have test users, try:

1. **Look for other sections** in the left sidebar
2. **Go back to main OAuth consent screen**:
   - Try this URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
   - Look for "EDIT APP" button and tab navigation

## 📋 Expected Test Users Section

You're looking for something like:
```
Test users
Add the email addresses of users who can test your app before publication.

Email addresses
[+ ADD USERS]

Add your email: noopurshukla2012@gmail.com
```

## 🎯 Quick Action Steps:

1. **Click "Audience"** in the left sidebar
2. **Look for test users or external users management**
3. **Add your email**: `noopurshukla2012@gmail.com`
4. **Save changes**

Try clicking on **"Audience"** first - that's most likely where the test users section is located!
